## Additional Notes
---
* This comes in mad clutch when you're like 7 trees in and it emails you. Trust me, at that time the $1.50 is so worth it. 
* The $1.50 fee is not meant to pull some crazy profit. This is mostly to prevent too many people from using the service, which might put me over my free hosting/data quotas. Plus, this service experiences some decreasing returns to scale (for those of you trying to get into ECON classes). If 20 people are all watching the same course, and they all get notified, its pretty pointless. 
* I can't believe I took all this time to make this. I'm graduated. I feel like such a freshman trying to get into classes.
    * I made this sometime around winterim '18, and mostly just used it for myself and some close friends of mine. Now that I'm graduated, I have no use for it anymore which is why I'm making it public.
