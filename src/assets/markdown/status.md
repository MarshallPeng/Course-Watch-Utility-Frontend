## Status - <span style="color:green"><b>LIVE</b></span>
---

The service is currently <b><span style="color:green">LIVE</span></b>. Though, this is only useful during the add-drop period.


## How To Use
---

1. Fill out the form with the information of the class you want to register for
2. I'll send you an email once there's a slot open
3. Go register before someone else does!


## Additional Notes
---

* I'm super cheap, so your email needs to be added to an authorized list. Just PM me and I'll add you :D. This is to prevent too many people from using the service, which might put me over my free hosting/data quotas. Plus, this service experiences some decreasing returns to scale (for those of you trying to get into ECON classes).
* You'll probably get quicker notifications if you use a non-Dartmouth email since Dartmouth tends to hold incoming emails and release them all at once. Just be sure to check this email frequently. It's your own fault if I notify you and you don't register
* The service will stop tracking after the first time it sees an empty slot in a class. If for some reason, you were busy and didn't get to register before the class filled up again, just fill out another request.
* I can't believe I took all this time to make this. I'm a junior... I feel like such a freshman trying to get into classes.
* This service does not work for classes that require Instructor Permission to join ... duh.
