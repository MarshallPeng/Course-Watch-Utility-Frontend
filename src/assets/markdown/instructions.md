## How to

1. Fill in the form with the requested information and pay $1.50
2. If a spot opens up, you'll receive an email within ~10 minutes. Please keep an eye out for this email
3. Go sign up before someone else does.

### Reminders

* This service only works when it's Add-Drop time. 
* If a class requires instructor permission or never opens, that's your own problem. Have fun.
* You'll probably get quicker notifications if you use a **non-dartmouth email** since Dartmouth likes to hold incoming emails and release them in bulk.
* If you really don't trust the payment option, email me, I'll manually add your requests, and we can work something out with like Venmo or something.
